maintenance will not affect the safe and efficient 
operations of the train system once construction is 
completed. Utility owners will be involved in providing 
any new utilities needed for the rail system and in 
designing the necessary diversions and protection 
measures to minimize the risk to existing utilities from 
ground movement and surface settlement.  
3. In case g as pipeline s are found during detailed utility 
survey prior to construction , Contractor will conduct the 
hazardous operation study to ensure the smooth and 
safe shifting.  
4. Utility shifting plan will be developed by CMRL and 
Contractor in coordination with concern authorities and 
shifting of utilities will be done as per agreed utility 
shifting plan prior to construction commenced. The plan 
will include required EHS management measures, 
supervision and monitoring of implementation, and final 
report and confirmation that construction works will be 
properly closed (for example, all waste will be removed 
or re-pavement will be completed as required).  
5. In case public utilities are required to be shifted to

 135 These utility services are essential and have to be maintained in working order 
during different stages of construction, by temporary/permanent diversions and 
relocation or by supporting in position. Any interruption to these will have serious 
repercussions on the most sensitive suburban services and direct impact on the 
public besides set back in construction and project implementation schedule & costs. 
They may require temporary or permanent diversion subject to their depth, details 
such as piling configuration or span of viaduct, utility protection measures, etc.  
136 During construction the most important and hazardous aspect will be pipelines 
network running along the alignment. A decision has to be taken regarding encasing 
these pipelines as shifting/relocating will be of great inconvenience to the residential 
areas. In case detailed pre -construction utility survey by Contractor identifies gas 
pipelines, HAZOP study (& risk analysis) will be conducted by contractor and CMRL 
during pre-construction period for any kind of handling of this issue in concurrence 
with gas supply agency. The similar study has to be conducted for water supply and 
high tension lines with the concurrence with concern ed agencies.  
137 In case public utilities are required to be shifted to private land in exceptional 
circumstances, then adequate compensation shall be made by CMRL to the property 
owner on the same principles as temporary land acquisition. Following completion of 
construction of metro, such utilities shall be rehabilitated on public land.    
138 Ground survey to confirm location of pipelines and other utilities will be done by 
Contractor after which detailed design consultant will revise, where feasible, spans 
and pile arrangement. Where the alignment cannot be fine -tuned to avoid conflict 
with utilities, permanent diversions will be done section wise before commencement 
of construction of viaduct work on the pertinent section; temporary diversions can be 
done before or during construction. Plans for diversion or relocation of any utilities 
along  with hazard studies if required will be prepared by the Contractor in 
consultation with and approval of respective utility agencies before finalisation of 
time schedule of metro construction works. Preferably they will have to be diverted 
by the agencies themselves. Any HAZOP investigation and utility diversion will be 
done 3 months before start of construction of viaduct (scheduled start of viaduct 
works is July 2021) .  
5.2.5 Impact s on Physical Cultural Resources  
139 No protected archaeological monuments / sites or heritage assets are located on the 
project corridor , except the Madras War Cemetery near Guindy have to be included, 
which is maintained by Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) . Of 213 
sensitive receptors which are located within 200m on either side of the alignment, 
158 are of having religious and cultural  value s.  
140 Since the project involves piling for piers there are possibilities that contractor may 
encounter art efacts during piling  operation . Chance find measures ar e included in 
the E MP to minimize the impacts  on historical / archeological artifacts, in case found 
during excavation work . CMRL will inform and coordinate with Arch aeological Survey 
of India if any ancient remains are encountered during construction work.  
141 At pre -identified culturally valuable sites if any near the alignment, or finds in the 
project’s direct area of impact  the contractor shall prepare a monitoring scheme prior 
to construction at such locations. This scheme for monitoring vibration level shall be 
submitted to CMRL for approval. The scheme shall include:  
• Monitoring requirements for vibrations at regular intervals throughout the 
construction period.

 5.3 Impacts and Mitigation Measures Due to Construction  
147 Although environmental hazards related to construction works ar e mostly of 
temporary nature.  Appropriate measures should be included in the work plan and 
budgeted for. The most likely negative impacts related to the construction works are:  
• Stormwater drainage and topsoil  erosion  
• Traffic diversion and risk to existing building  
• Air pollution due to d ust g eneration  
• Noise and vibrations  
• Increased energy demand and impacts on Water  
• Impact due to supply of construction m aterial  
• Disposal of construction and demolition w aste 
• Disposal of Hazardous Waste  
• Dewatering of Excavat ions 
• Impacts due to batching plant and casting yard  
• Impacts of labour camps  
• Health and Safety  
5.3.1 Soil Erosion Impact  
148 Certain viaduct sections and station accesses require land outside the road right of 
way resulting in change of landuse characteristics . Change in land use and 
excavation of soil will lead to soil erosion. Every care has to be t aken to avoid 
damage to the top soil (more specific) fr om construction sites and yards.  It has to be 
preserved and utilized. Problems could arise from d umping of construction spoils 
(concrete, bricks) waste materials (from contractor camps) etc . causing surface and 
ground water pollution.  
149 Balance  C5 will have elevated track and there are 23 elevated stations. Soil 
excavation will be required for piling activities for metro piers. Muck from piling and 
excavation activity  containing Bentonite would also be generated in the project.  
150 Mitigation measures : The excavated soil would be used for refilling at station site but 
muck from piling work will be disposed at locations/sites approved by pollution 
control board and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee . Responsibility of disposal of 
this soil will lies with contractor and will be regulated by standard norms . Disposal of 
Bentonite would be at designated landfill site  approved by Government authorities . 
151 Soil can be washed away from the temporary stacking of excavated soil on site 
before it is utilised for refill or disposed in environmentally friendly manner. Soil 
erosion by runoff will be controlled by installing proper drainage system.  
152 Excavated top fertile soil can be preserved and used later for green  belt 
development/ land scaping. Part of the excavated soil from piling would be re -used 
for refilling and balance will be disposed. Estimated quantity of disposable soil is  
0.12 million cum , whereas 0.087 million cum of soil has been disposed as of 
December 2023 .  
153  If this muck is not contaminated by hazardous substances such as heavy metals  or 
POPs2, the contractor will be permitted to sell it as fill for activities outside the project;

of noise will be most intense in 
the residential / urban areas.  1. The routing, timing and logistics of the haul truck 
movement should be planned to have minimal impacts 
on noise level.  
2. The route selection will avoid any sensitive receptors.  
3. Efforts should be made to keep the noise levels under 
control by appropriate noise attenuation and adopting 
employee safety measures.  
4. Wherever baseline noise already exceeds the 
standards, only 3dB of noise increase is allowed.  If 
baseline noise is below the CPCB and IFC -EHS

46.  Operation of metro trains  Noise 
and 
Vibration  The most significant source of 
noise will be rolling noise from 
contact between wheel and rail 
including noise from contact 
between the brake pad and 
wheel, followed by engine 
noise and aerodynamic noise.  1. To minimize operation stage impacts measures such as 
Ballast less track structure is supported on two layers of 
rubber pads to reduce noise and vibrations. In addition, 
baffle wall as parapets will be constructed up to the rail 
level so as reduce sound levels. Noise at source will be 
controlled or reduced by incorporating suitable feature 
in the design of structures and layout of machines and 
by use of resilient mounting and dampers etc.  
2.  Since the rakes will be air conditioned and enclosed 
from all side, the impacts of noise on the travelers will 
be nominal.  
3. Noise barriers will be installed at locations based on 
final design noise prediction analysis.  
4. Wherever baseline noise already exceeds the 
standards, only 3dB of noise increase is allowed.  If 
baseline noise is below the CPCB and IFC -EHS 
standards, the operation  noise has to meet these 
standards that is, noise level has to be less than level 
prescribed in these standards . 
5. The mitigations suggested based on the detailed noise 
and vibration analysis, should be strictly followed.  CMRL  CMRL

5.4.1 Noise and Vibration s  
216 Airborne noise level increases with train speed, decreases with ballasted tie -welded 
track with elastic fastenings and absorbing pad and well-maintained  wheel and rail 
condition. Vibration is found to be higher with higher speeds and lower with heavier 
transit structure.  The vibration is generally caused by rail-wheel interaction. This can 
be reduced by minimizing any surface irregularities on the wheel and rail. To 
minimize the vibration shock absorbing pad must  be provided and there has to be a 
distance between rail seat assembly and concrete plinth.  
217 For elevated corridors, ballast less track structure is supported on two layers of 
rubber pads to reduce noise and vibrations. In addition, baffle wall as parapets will 
be constructed up  to the rail level so as reduce sound levels. Noise at source will be 
controlled or reduced by incorporating suitable feature in the design of structures 
and layout of machines and by use of resilient mounting and dampers etc.  
218 These noise generations for metro operation activities have been recorded from past 
experience from existing Metros in India as well as project authorities. The following 
data includes various noise levels in above activities. During the operation phase the 
main source of noise will be from running of metro trains. Noise radiated from train 
operations and track structures generally constitute the major noise sources. 
Airborne noise is radiated from elevated structures. The noise level at 2 m distance 
from the rail alignment is about 73 dB(A) which is higher than the CPCB permissible 
limit of 65 dB(A) , and is much higher than the 50 dB (A) daytime limit for silence 
zone  The noise level reduces with distance logarithmically. Refer Tables 5.9 and 
5.10.

3.2 Associated Facilities  
56 As per ADB’s SPS 2009, the a ssociated facilities are those that are not included or 
funded by the Project but are: (i) directly and materially related to the Project; (ii) 
carried out or planned to be carried out, contemporaneously with the Project; and (iii) 
necessary for the Project to be viable and would not be constructed or expanded if 
the Project did not exist.  
57 The remaining  section of Corridor  5, which starts  from Madhavaram to CMBT  
financed by JICA constitutes one of the Associated Facilities to Balance  C5. A due 
diligence survey  of sensitive locations was conduct ed. The avoidance and mitigation 
measures have been inco rporated in the EMP.  
58 From chainage 31300 to chainage 31700 after St. Thomas Mount Station, Southern 
Railways and CMRL agreed to take up their structures constructed within the same 
right of way available with MRTS. This stretch has been assessed as part of this EIA. 
Though not fully constitute  the associated facility, t o have a closer association and 
review the works as per the specifications, it is agreed to have joint meetings on 
quarterly basis to review the safeguard performance and documentations  (Annexure 
2).  
59 The construction and operation of Balance C5 will require power and water from the 
existing  electricity grid and water supply system. Electricity is required for the 
operation  of the Metro  system for running  trains, station services ( e.g. lighting, lifts, 
escalators, signaling  & telecom, firefighting etc. within premises of the metro  system ). 
The power requirements of a metro system are determined by peak -hour demands of 
power for traction and auxiliary applications. These existing grid substations and 
water supply network are being operated and managed by respective agenc ies in full 
compliance with state and local policies and regulatory frameworks.  
60 Chennai City has 230kV, 110kV, 33kV power transmission and distribution network to 
cater to various types of demand in the vicinity of proposed corridor. Keeping in view 


Document 41: 42 
 
 *OFFICIAL USE ONLY  
of reliability requirements of the corridor, four RSSs are proposed to avail power 
supply for traction as well as auxiliary services from Tamil Nadu Transmission 
Corporation Limited grid sub -stations at 110kV voltage through transmission lines or 
cable feeders for Corridor  5. M/s Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation 
Limited  (TANGEDCO ) has confirmed the availability of supply.   
61 Gas Insulated Substation (GIS), which offer the advantage of considerable saving in 
space requirement as well as reduced maintenance, are proposed for each 
Receiving cum Traction Substation and Auxiliary Substations of Balance C5. Each 
elevated station shall be provided with an Auxiliary Substation with two 33kV/415V, 
3-phase, 500 kVA dry type cast resin transformers and the associated HT & LT 
switchgear. In addition, provision shall be made for one DG set at each station for 
emergency loads. In addition, it is proposed to provide standby DG set of 250 kVA at 
all elevated stations to cater to all emergency loads.  Power Demand is estimated in 
Table 3.3.  
62 During construction, water consumption will be of the order of 4 48 KLD for 
construction  and 270 KLD for lab our camps . During operation, the water demand at  
station s for cleaning , drinking, toilet, and air conditioning will be of the order of 381 
KLD (16.6KLD for each station)  Source : CMRL Phase II DPR . 
63 Water for dust suppression (sprinkling) and wheel / vehicle body  washing will be 
sourced from surface runoff, wastewater from construction sites, construction yards 
and seawater. Used water from wheel / vehicle body  washing are treated  and re-
used. Water for curing of concrete will be sourced from municipal supply, surface 
runoff or water from dewatering. Water for concrete batching plants  and labour 
camps were  sourced through CMWSSB.  
64 Rain water from construction yards, work areas  and Labour  camps will be discharged 
into public storm water drains ; it will be treated by municipal agencies to Environment 
Protection Rules (EPR) 1986 Schedule VI standards of discharge of general effluents 
into surface water. In view of the distributed nature of the linear construction and 
quantities of wastewater , it is not proposed install sewage and effluent treatment 
plants by CMRL.  If feasible ETP/STP may be proposed to install  at work areas.  
65 The water requirement for the stations will be met through the public water supply 
system  i.e. through CMWSSB . CMWSSB water supply will be supplemented by 
rainwater harvesting at elevated stations.  
 
3.3 Implementation Plan , Schedule  and Cost  
66 Balance  C5 will be implemented under design consultant and civil work contracts. 
There will be several packages for different components such as civil works contracts, 
detailed design, system contracts, supply and installations, rolling stocks etc. It is 
estimated that the project  will be co mmissioned 53 months from award of civil works . 
Table 3. 11 shows  the detailed schedule s of the two civil work packages . The capital 
cost of Balance  C5 including taxes and duties for December 2018 is estimated at 
USD 1 ,037 million .  
 
67 The project progress status shall be presented in the monthly progress report ( MPR ),  
and quarterly progress report ( QPR ) under the Project.
